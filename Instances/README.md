# About this folder

This folder contains all instances of the RGP problem used in my master's thesis and some larger ones that modern computers can handle.

File name formation rule is:
    *w[x]h[y]n[p]i[#].pt*
  
  where:
  
     x = square height in points
     
     y = square length in points
     
     p = number of inner points
     
     # = instance number
