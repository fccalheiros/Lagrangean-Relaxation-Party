# Lagrangean-Relaxation-Party
A C++ program for solving Rectangular Partitions using Lagrangian Relaxation, which tries to be generic enough that you can easily build your own case.

This code is the result of my master's degree completed more than 20 years ago. Recently during the Pandemic I added Branch & Bound capabilities. It worked but I have to say I'm not a programmer anymore so there will be much better ways to do this.

I now share this code with the aim that students have a starting point and are able to implement a Lagrangian Relaxation for the problem they want, without going through all the challenges that this type of implementation offers.

I will briefly explain how to do this later...

I also have some problems with the code (a program never ends) which I will share here. If you are an enthusiast, feel free to contribute. Also feel free to suggest new topics.

Here you have some links to my work. Unfortunately, my master's thesis is written in Portuguese (as you may have noticed, English is not one of my talents). The article is paid for, but I believe you can find a free version by searching Google.
